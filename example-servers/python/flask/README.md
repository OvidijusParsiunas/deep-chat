![Deep Chat](../../../assets/readme/flask-connect.png)

This is an example Flask server template that can be used to communicate with the [Deep Chat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deep-chat) component. It includes a variety of endpoints that can be used to host your own service or act as a proxy for the following AI APIs - [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api), [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index), [StabilityAI](https://stability.ai/), [Cohere](https://docs.cohere.com/docs).

### :calling: UI component

This project is preconfigured to work with the example [UI project](https://github.com/OvidijusParsiunas/deep-chat/tree/main/example-servers/ui). Once both are running - they should be able to communicate with each other right out of the box.

### :computer: Local setup

If you are downloading the project via `git clone` - we advise you to use shallow cloning with the use of the [--depth 1](https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/git-beyond-basics-using-shallow-clones) option to reduce its size:

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/OvidijusParsiunas/deep-chat.git
```

Navigate to the `src` directory and run the following command to initialize and activate a python virtual environment

```
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
```
Install the required python packages:

```
pip install flask flask-cors load_dotenv requests
```

Run the project:

```
python app.py
```

If you want to use the proxies, please create an `.env` file and define the corresponding environment variables. E.g. if you want to use OpenAI API, define the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable. See the `.env.example` file.
